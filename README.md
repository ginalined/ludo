**Description**:

Our project was originated from Aeroplane Chess, a Chinese cross-and-circle board game similar to the western game of Ludo and the Indian game of Pachisi. Developed in the 20th century, Aeroplane Chess features airplanes as pieces instead of the more abstract pawns and beehive-shaped pieces found in the games from which it is derived. 

**Rule:**

1. Each player starts with 4 planes in the airport, and each player rolls dice alternatively.
2. Each plane will not get out of the airport if the player does not roll a 6.
3. Once the player rolls a 6, the player can choose a plane to get out of the airport.
4. After that, the player can move the selected plane steps of the dice result. 
5. Once all four planes of a player get to the destination, the player win. 



**Contribution**:

​	Write the basic board and the collision feature of this program. 

Yang Li:

​	Implemented the dice animation and texture mapping.

​	Implemented bump mapping feature on the gold block in the middle and at the end of the scene.

Taixing Shi:
	Implemented the airplane model, the sky background, and the game control mechanism. 



**How to run:**

​	Press "c"  to roll the dice. Every time you rolled a 6, you can choose a plane to move from the airport to the field, or choose a plane that is already on the filed to move 6 steps, and you can roll the dice again. 			Choose a plane  on the field to move according to the dice result. Use "", "y", "u", "j","h" key to choose plane, and use "i", "o", "l", "k" to display the corresponding number of the plane. When all planes from one team reach the center, the player win, and the winning scene will appear. More controls are in the movement panel.
